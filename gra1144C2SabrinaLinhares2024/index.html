    <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
 
	  <ol> 
		  <li>In a medium size saucepan, pour out the condensed milk, heavy cream and the chocolate. Stir it until it is all homogeneous. </li>
		<li>Bring the saucepan to the stove over medium heat. </li>
		 <li>Add the butter to bring a beautiful shine to the brigadeiro. </li>
		 <li>Keep stirring until the mix is not sticking in the pan anymore. One trick to know if it is ready, it is, slowly, lean the saucepan a little bit and everything comes out of the pan. </li>
		  <li>Take it out of heat and let it cool in a plate and cover it with plastic wrap, this will keep the brigadeiro soft and creamy. </li>
		 <li>Let it cool for at least 2 hours, or until you touch the bottom of the plate, and it is not hot anymore.</li>
		 <li>The last step is like going back to your childhood and playing with playdough.</li>
